5. Original URL viewing notes:
When uploading the video to Bilibili, both the image quality and frame rate have been reduced, so it doesn't look very smooth and confusing
Go to the original website: https://penghaifu.github.io/penghaifu/ High viewing frame rate, clear picture quality
The higher the resolution of the screen, the more realistic it looks (so sometimes it can be a good choice to watch on a mobile phone, although the screen is small, the resolution of the phone is generally higher than that of a computer.)
A screen with higher frame rates appears smoother
6. PC browser notes:
Press F11 to enter full screen mode for a more realistic effect.
Page deformation can refresh the webpage, and PC browsers can use F5 to refresh
Enabling hardware acceleration in the browser will make animations smoother (unclear on Baidu)
Not currently supported for browsers below IE10

If you have any opinions or suggestions, please leave a message below
